## STAMPS Code of Conduct

All STAMPS attendees are expected to agree with the following code of conduct. We will enforce this code as needed. We expect cooperation from all attendees to help ensuring a safe environment for everybody. Additional the Marine Biological Laboratory expects [respect and responsibility](http://www.mbl.edu/hr/files/2013/12/2017-MBL-Respect-and-Responsiblity-Flyer.pdf)has a formal [Code of Conduct](http://www.mbl.edu/policies/code-of-conduct/).

### The Quick Version
STAMPS events are neither a dating scene nor an intellectual contest.

STAMPS is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof). We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is generally not appropriate for any STAMPS venue.

### The Less Quick Version

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Attendees asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact Tracy Teal or Mihai Pop immediately. If either is the cause of your concern, please see the MBLâ€™s Equal Employment Opportunity Coordinator at 508-289-7378 or eeo@mbl.edu.

We expect participants to follow these guidelines at any STAMPS-related event.
