## Before you arrive

Welcome to STAMPS 2018!

This is a hands on course for you to learn about tools and perspectives and get practical experience working with the tools. Therefore
you should plan to bring:

- a laptop that you can install software on
- a power cord (with USA compatible power)

On the first day of the course, we'll start with an introduction to the command line and R. Installation is as much a part of 
bioinformatics as running the programs and can take some time. To make the best use of time on that first day, we ask that you 
try to install both a command line program and R and RStudio.

Installation instuctions are available on our [installation instructions page](installation.md). TAs and instructors will be available 
at breaks to help with any issues around installation, so don't worry if you run into trouble. Downloading the programs and starting
the installation will go a long way to helping everyone get set up.
