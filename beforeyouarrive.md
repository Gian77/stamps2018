## Before you arrive

Welcome to STAMPS 2018!

This is a hands on course for you to learn about tools and perspectives and get practical experience working with the tools. Therefore
you should plan to bring:

- a laptop that you can install software on
- a power cord (with USA compatible power)

On the first day of the course, we'll start with an introduction to the command line and R. Installation is as much a part of bioinformatics as running the programs (often the more difficult part, especially at first!), and it can take some time. To make the best use of time on that first day and get us started off, we ask that you try to install a command-line program, R, and RStudio.

Installation instuctions to help are available on our [installation instructions page](installation.md). TAs and instructors will be available during the class and at breaks to help with any issues around installation, so don't worry if you run into trouble. Downloading the programs and starting the installation ahead of time will go a long way to helping everyone get set up.
