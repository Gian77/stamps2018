## Course Projects

For STAMPS 2018, we will have student projects to give you an opportunity
to practice the skills and perspectives you've learned, integrate them in
a project setting and work with course colleagues in small teams. 

We will provide a few datasets and the metadata and some context, and your
group will formulate questions to ask of the data, conduct analyses and
generate outcomes. You may use your own dataset or other publicly available data, but you must have it 
approved by Tracy or Mihai. There is often significant data preparation 
required before analysis that may not be feasible for the length of the 
course.
