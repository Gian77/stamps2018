## Course Projects

For STAMPS 2018, we will have student projects to give you an opportunity
to practice the skills and perspectives you've learned, integrate them in
a project setting and work with course colleagues in small teams. 

We will provide a few datasets and the metadata and some context, and your
group will formulate questions to ask of the data, conduct analyses and
generate outcomes. You may use your own dataset or other publicly available data, but you must have it 
approved by Tracy or Mihai. There is often significant data preparation 
required before analysis, or a longer analysis, that may not be feasible for the length of the 
course.

### Project outline

- Step 1: Step 1 of your project will be getting to know your data. What kinds of things are interesting about your data? How many samples and permutations do you have? What kinds of questions can you ask and what are interesting?
- Step 2: Once you've identified one or a few questions, conceptually how are you going to approach it. Outline the project steps conceptually or in pseudocode.
- Step 3: Set up your project. You can do this in github, or Google drive, or some other collaborative sharing space. (Add links on how to set up a project)
- Step 4: Start your analyses or data exploration. Don't forget to document the steps you're taking! You likely will try out a few things. That's good! So, documenting won't be 'methods' quality yet, but you want to remember what you did. When you decide on the analysis path, add more notes and documentation. You want future you and your other group members to be able to replicate your results.
- Step 5: Think about your output. Does it make sense? How could you plot it to display the information? How could you think about describing results.
- Step 6: Iterate back through one to many of these steps
